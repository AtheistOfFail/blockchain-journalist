For most industries, being able to manage items in the real world with multiple companies participating can reduce operation costs to lower and lower levels. One of the key components behind Bitcoin, the blockchain has been recognized as being a public ledger that can be used for assigning value without having to trust a specific company or bank. Coming from nothing in 2009, Bitcoin has become a major force for good, achieving better stability (and deflationary value) than many global currencies between 2009 and now (exception being 2013). The currency has had an uphill battle for it's usage in dark market dealings, mainly for enabling the purchasing of drugs. Just like cash, it can be used to purchase tobacco, alcohol and even acetaminophen. As more and more industries enter into the blockchain environments, we may see far more investment in this technology with the intent of reducing cost or allowing for distributed assignment of assets both in the virtual or real world.",
